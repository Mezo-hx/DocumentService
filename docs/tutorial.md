# Tutorial

Imagine you're making a game, the player can get Coins and XP. Wouldn't want the Player Data from simply vanishing when the player closes the game, would you?

## Setting Up the PlayerData Module

We'll need to start with getting services and the required modules
```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

local DocumentService = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.ThirdParty.DocumentService)
local Guard = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Utils.Guard)
```
Here, we're fetching two Modules:
- `DocumentService`: To simply get access to the DocumentService module.
- `Guard`: This module essentially acts as a type-checker.

## Defining the Player's Data Structure

And then, we'll need to focus on the `DataSchema`, `DataInterface`, a function to validate data, and a `DocumentStore`.

**DataSchema**:
The DataSchema defines the Data that will be stored for each Player. For this, each player would have `Coins` and `XP`
```lua
type DataSchema = {
    Coins: number,
    XP: number,
}
```
It could be extended further, but to keep things simple, we'll only be keeping `Coins` and `XP`

**DataInterface**:
The DataInterface helps validate that the data types are correct. The `Guard` Module is used for this
```lua
local DataInterface = {
    Coins = Guard.Integer,
    XP = Guard.Integer,
}
```

**DataCheck**:
Of course, we'd need a function to validate the player's data. This is where `dataCheck` comes in. It ensures the data we're working with matches the format defined in `DataSchema`
```lua
local function dataCheck(value: unknown): DataSchema
	assert(type(value) == "table", "Data must be a table")
	local Value: any = value

	return {
		Coins = DataInterface.Coins(Value.Coins),
		XP = DataInterface.XP(Value.XP),
	}
end
```

**DocumentStore**:
This is where we create a new `DocumentStore` and specify the **default** values for each property, and how it should be managed.
```lua
local PlayerDataStore = DocumentService.DocumentStore.new({
	dataStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerData"),
	check = Guard.Check(dataCheck),
	default = {
		Coins = 0,
		XP = 0,
	},
	migrations = {
		backwardsCompatible = false, 
	},
	lockSessions = true,
})
```
- `BackwardsCompatible`: if perhaps you update your DataSchema, players will only be able to join the up-to-date servers if this option is `False`. Otherwise, players can join older servers without hinderance.
- `LockSessions`: prevents multiple or the same device from accessing a player's data simultaneously.

## Managing Player Data with Functions

Let's define two functions: `GetDocument` and `CloseDocument`

**GetDocument**:
This functions retrieves the player's document, allowing us to access their data.
```lua
function PlayerData:GetDocument(player: Player)
	return PlayerDataStore:GetDocument(`{player.UserId}`)
end
```

CloseDocument:
If a player were to leave the game, we can run this function to prevent it from being lost.
```lua
function PlayerData:CloseDocument(player: Player)
	local document = PlayerDataStore:GetDocument(`{player.Name}_{player.UserId}`)

	if not document:IsOpen() and document:IsOpenAvailable() then
		document:Open()
	end

	if document and document:IsOpen() then
		local successfulClose, closeResult = pcall(function()
			return document:Close()
		end)

		if not successfulClose then
			warn("Failed to close document for player:", player.Name, "Error:", closeResult)
		end
	else
		warn("Failed to retrieve document for player:", player.Name)
	end
end
```

## Best Practices. And When to use What

Write your scripts in strict mode. This is essential to make use of the main benefits of DocumentService, because Luau will tell you when you do silly things.

A good linter (luau-lsp) and selene for VSCode. Roblox Studio lints are mostly hidden and useless, which does not allow you to utilise the libraryâ€™s typechecking support to its fullest.

Put your `DataSchema`, `DataInterface`, and `dataCheck` in a separate ModuleScript. It helps keeping things clean and ultimately, easier to edit.

If you want to edit player's data, you'd do:
```lua
-- Server
local document = YourPlayerDataModule:GetDocument(player)

if not document:IsOpen() and document:IsOpenAvailable() then
	document:Open()
end

local documentClone = table.clone(document:GetCache())

documentClone.Coins = 99
documentClone.XP = 99
document:SetCache(documentClone)
```

- `document:SetCache()`: This allows us to set the Cache of the player data. And once the player leaves, we can simply save their data afterwards with `document:Close()` or `PlayerDataModule:CloseDocument(player)`

Perhaps you want to get the player's data from the Client:
```lua
-- Server
GetPlayerData_Remote:Connect(function(player)
	local playerDocument = PlayerData:GetDocument(player)

	if playerDocument then
		return playerDocument:Read()
	end

	return {}
end)

-- Client
local playerDocument = GetPlayerData_Remote:Invoke()

print(playerDocument.XP) -- 99
print(playerDocument.Coins) -- 99
```
- `playerDocument:Read()`: This simply returns the current Data of the player. Why not `playerDocument:Open()`? well, the client wouldn't be editing Data. So, we simply call `:Read()`
