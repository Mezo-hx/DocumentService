# Opening a player document

This is an example of how to open a document for a DocumentStore that deals with player data.
Opening a session-locked document will enable autosaves. At the time of writing, these happen every 150 seconds.
The following code should run on `Players.PlayerAdded`:

 ```lua
local document = store:GetDocument(tostring(player.UserId))
local result = document:Open()

-- DocumentService retries 5 times over 16 seconds, so it is safe to steal
-- after a failed `:Open`!
if not result.success and result.reason == "SessionLockedError" then
    document:Steal()
    result = document:Open()
end

if not result.success then
    if result.reason == "BackwardsCompatibilityError" then
        player:Kick(
            "You joined an old server which does not support your saved data."
                .. "Please try joining another server. If this persists, contact a developer."
        )
    end

    if result.reason == "RobloxAPIError" then
        player:Kick("Failed to load data due to a Roblox service issue. Try again later.")
    end

    player:Kick(
        `Failed to load data: {result.reason}. Please screenshot this message and report it to a developer.`
    )

    return false
end
```

You should close documents when a player leaves. Note that I have not created a player documents table.
You should use `:GetDocument` to retrieve the document - there is usually no need to create a table to
reference your player documents. See the API reference for `GetDocument` for information on when documents are
garbage collected.
